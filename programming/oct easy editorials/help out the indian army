Problem:

You are given a line segment starting from S and ending at E along with few points on this line segment. (For simplicity assume it to be on X axis).
For each of these points two values are associated: 
	xi(denotes the position of point w.r.t origin)
	pi(extent to which a point can secure the line segment). 
	(This point can secure length from xi-pi to xi+pi)

Find the total length which is not secured by any point on the line segment.


Solution to this problem is straight forward. 

1) Find all the segments which are secured in ascending order of their distance from orgin (if distance from origin is same, sort acc. to lengths). 
2) start scanning all segments sorted in step 1 and add the unsecured area to the total count
3) total count is the required answer.

STL makes implementation of above algorithm really easy. Have a look at setter's and tester's solution for reference.
